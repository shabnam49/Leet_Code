'''
Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:

Input: [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]

Note:

    You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
    Minimize the total number of operations.
